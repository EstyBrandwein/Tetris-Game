# tetrisgame

A new Flutter project of a Tetris Game.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The goal of the game is to arrange cubes at the bottom of the screen as much as possible without spaces in a sequence of cubes. When the dice form a complete row without a space, the row disappears, and the dice stacked above it fall one "floor". When the dice stack up to the top edge of the screen the game is over.
